Hello! This is a database-driven movie information site with full CRUD functionality for over 1200+ movies that I developed. It was designed with a recently released page for films that are currently playing in theaters by extracting data from MovieDB API. I had also incorporated JQuery to visualize metrics for each movie (poster, title, rating, and release date). Finally, it was implemented with a search page with multiple criteria to dynamically populate result and detail pages. I ensured smooth user experience with error handling and validation.
